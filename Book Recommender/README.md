Book Recommender System: Inspired from LDA (Udacity NLP Course)
===============================================================

This code implements recommender system using database of 16559 books including its summary, title.. extracted from the November 2, 2012 dump of English-language Wikipedia. 
The idea used here is based on the Latent Dirchlet Allocation (LDA) approach   learning as a part of Udacity NLP course. The recommender system generates recommendations  to only those books that are in the corpus. It displays a message that the book doesnot exists in the database when queries with  books outside the data base.

Data for this code can be obtained from  [CMU Book Summary Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html). Add data to a subdirectory. 

Please refer [Book Recommeder system](https://humboldt-wi.github.io/blog/research/information_systems_1819/is_lda_final/) and
